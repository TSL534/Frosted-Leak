# You may ask why would I leak our Bot Src ?

- Our owner (Obaqz) struck a deal with a user named aguyonminecraft (Vision) approximately two days ago, giving him the complete source code and bot tokens.  
- They then nuked our main Discord and staff server and made an older version of the bot and private data, including account tokens and command logs, public on a GitHub repository.  
- Lucky, I Chnaged the main bot token and they did not have access to the new VPS This prevented them from leaking all user information or destroying other servers that the main bot was on.  

- You are Free to use the Bot Src or modify the Bot source Code or use it in Your Owen Projects.
